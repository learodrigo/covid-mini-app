# Static props with Next.js

The scope was to, via an API, collect data abour COVID-19 worldwide and create some graphs with routes. The goal of this repo was to understand server side React components. I follow [Next.js Static Props](https://pomb.us/nextjs-static-props/) post by [@pomber](https://github.com/pomber). The API used, is also mantain by him. Graphs are powered by [nivo.rocks](https://nivo.rocks/)
